/*The continue keyword in Java (and many other programming languages) is used to skip the current iteration
 of a loop and move on to the next iteration. It's typically used within for, while,
 or do-while loops when you want to skip certain steps based on a condition, without 
exiting the loop entirely (which would be done using break). */
